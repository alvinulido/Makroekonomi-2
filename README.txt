3. Notes on LaTeX:

I highly recommend using LaTeX for typing up highly mathematical documents/works, but I realize that LaTeX can be a bit daunting at first for those who are uninitiated. If you’re new to LaTeX, use Overleaf (it’s much easier and doesn’t require you to set-up your own TeX client (like TeXShop etc.) on your desktop, which can be really cumbersome

I provide sample Overleaf document (please copy and paste the link) below:
